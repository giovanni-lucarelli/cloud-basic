# Comparative Performance Evaluation of Virtual Machine (VirtualBox) and Container (Docker) Environments

## Introduction

Contemporary computing relies heavily on technologies that optimize resource allocation and application management. Virtualization, primarily implemented via Virtual Machines (VMs), provides hardware abstraction, allowing the execution of multiple, fully independent guest operating systems on a single physical host, ensuring strong isolation. In contrast, containerization, exemplified by Docker, offers OS-level virtualization. It isolates application processes within containers that share the host's kernel but have their own filesystem and dependencies, resulting in lower overhead and faster instantiation. The widespread adoption of both VMs and containers underscores their importance in enabling server consolidation, simplifying deployment pipelines, facilitating microservices architectures, and forming the bedrock of cloud-based services.
