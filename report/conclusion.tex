\section{Conclusion}

In this project, was implemented and tested two cluster environments: one based on VirtualBox virtual machines and the other using Docker containers. The goal was to evaluate the performance and ease of setup of both environments, particularly in the context of cloud computing applications. The implementation and benchmarking of the two cluster environments -- one using VirtualBox virtual machines and the other based on Docker containers -- highlighted clear differences in both setup complexity and performance. The Docker-based cluster proved significantly easier to configure, particularly in terms of network setup and shared filesystem integration. Performance testing across CPU, memory, I/O, and network benchmarks consistently showed that the Docker cluster outperformed the VM-based cluster. Notably, the most significant bottlenecks in the virtual machine setup were observed in memory and network performance, which were markedly inferior compared to the containerized environment. These results suggest that container-based clustering offers substantial advantages for lightweight and high-performance deployments in cloud computing contexts.
