\section{Introduction}
The objective of this project is to conduct a comparative performance evaluation of a cluster of nodes as Virtual Machines (VMs) and Containers, specifically focusing on VirtualBox and Docker.  
The evaluation will be based on a series of benchmarks that measure various performance metrics, including CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network throughput, namely: \texttt{hpcc}, \texttt{stressng}, \texttt{sysbench}, \texttt{IOZone}, \texttt{iperf}. Finally some of them will be discussed comparing the performance of the two supports and whenever possible also with the ones ont he sole host machine (no cluster).
